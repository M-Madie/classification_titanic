# Logestic Regression Classification - Titanic Project

This repository contains one of my first projects as a data science student - an exploration of the well known titanic data set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and the development of a predictive model.

<ins>The repository includes the following files:</ins>
**Task_Titanic.ipynb** - an exploration of the titanic data set 
**Task_titanic_model.ipynb** - a logestic regression prediction model
**Task_titanic_pipiline.py** - a script for running the model on the data set
