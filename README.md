# Logestic Regression Classification - Titanic Project

This repository contains one of my first projects as a data science student taken from my student repo (copy of finalized files) - an exploration of the well known titanic data set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and the development of a predictive model.

<ins>The repository includes the following files:</ins>
* Task_Titanic - an exploration of the titanic data set 
* Task_titanic_model - a logestic regression prediction model
* Task_titanic_pipiline - a script for running the model on the data set
